title: Grading

#### Scores
There are many expections, homeworks, assigments and/or quizes, and a several large ones. All of them are individually scored on a scale of 1-100 which you can interpret as follows:

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*      40: Not handed in

#### Deadlines and consequences
* All homework is due by when the class starts
* Homeworks are scored on a 1-100 scale
* You can get an extension by talking to the TA, up to a point
* If you hand it in after a granted extension you will loose 15 points on it
* If you don't hand it in at all then you get 40 points for it, which will significantly affect the average!

#### Mid term and Final Grade

These are calculated as a weighted average of the individual homeworks. The weights are as follows:

* **Class Participation:** 10%
  * Do you show up on time (or let the teachers know ahead of time if you cannot?)
  * Do you ask good questions, and contribute to the discussion?
  Do you help the class move forward and stay focused?
  * When called on or in discussions do you demonstrate that you have done the assigned reading or work?
  * Do you keep up with the homework? Do you submit the warmup questions in Latte by 8:00am on the day of class?

* **Contribution to the Team:** 20%
  * Do you contribute personally to your team?
  * Are you a positive influence on productivity?
  * Do your team mates like working with you?
  * Are you at the center of problems or of solutions?
  * This is based on teacher-, self- and peer- assessment

* **Individual Assignments :** 30%
  * Don't just summarize or regurgitate the reading
  * Give a personal perspective or insight
  * Make connections to other readings or work or your own research
  * Have an interesting take or point of view

* **Team Deliverables**: 40%
	* Team homeworks, progress reports, blog posts, etc
	* Pilot project thinking, applicaiton of LS process, etc
	* Applying Lean Startup: getting out of the building, iterating, hypotheses etc
	* Final Deliverables
	* Final presentations

* **Extra Credit:**
  * Ask me if you want to do an extra credit assignment (see below)
  * The latest you can ask me is two weeks before the last day of instruction
  * Note: it's easier to push your grade up by doingn well on the core assignments
  * An excellent job here will bump your grade at most one step (e.g. B+ -> A-)

#### Notes

* **Class Participation:** includes being in class on time when the class starts, handing in homeworks that are assigned, being prepared by having done the reading, coding, viewing assigned so that when you are called on in class you can have something to say.

* **Warmup Exercises:** Many times there is a warmup exercise for a reading. Those are only graded based on participation never for correctness. They have to be submitted before 8:00am the day of class to even be considered.

* **Team Contribution:** Working in teams is hard and requires a businesslike, constructive, flexible, respectful behavior among the team members. Remember that I am not asking you to become best friends, just to figure out how to get the most out of each other.  We use peer and self assessmentws, because by myself I won't be able to tell if you are just along for the ride, or actually doing a lot of work.

#### Working in teams

* In my experience, on rare occasions, one member of the team becomes a bystander while others do the work, or one member takes over and does almost all the work. This is not the idea, so I might confidentially ask students their view of how well the team is functioning.

* For team deliverables each student on the team will get the same score on each item. A student will likely be on a different team for the pilot vs. the term project but in any event, each member of the team gets the same score on each team deliverable.

* Notice that separate from the grade for team deliverables there is an individual grade for your work as a team member. Are you an active contributor, do the other team members rely and count on you, do you add to or delete from the drama

#### Extra Credit

* IMPORTANT:
  * The deadline for requesting approval for a extra credit assignment is 2 weeks before the last day of class. For example, if you ask to do an extra credit assignment 1 week before the end of the term, I will not approve.
  * If you do an extra credit assignment without approval, it will not be graded and will not count.
* Possible ideas:
 * Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign for your term project. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required.
 * Think about an activity that you are seriously passionate about... It might be a cause, a performing art, some scientific endeavor, a hobby. Consider how exactly you would apply the Lean Startup methodology to increasing your impact and success in that arena.
 * Investigate by reading scholarly papers, or books, or other online resources whether there are competing philosophies to the Lean Startup. Write an analysis of the conflict and give your own views of whether the conflict is real and serious, and where you come out on it yourself.
