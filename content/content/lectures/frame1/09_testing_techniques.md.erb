**Legend**: <%=partbadge%>:Participation <%= timebadge %>:Early <%= pdfbadge %>:PDF

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Read** The following articles:
  * [Growing Convertkit to $5,020 in Monthly Recurring Revenue](http://nathanbarry.com/5k/).
  * [Experiment Examples to Get You Started Testing your Idea](https://firm.builders/experiment-examples-to-get-you-started-to-test-your-idea-6c0a3690c702#.ag6a9p1s1)
  * [Idea to Paying Customers in 7 Weeks: How We Did It](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it)
  * This is an individual assignment. Based on this reading, write up one or two original ideas for MVPs that you think would be really effective for your product. Preferably not a google form. Write it up in a way that you could acually implement it over the coming weekend. Make sure you tie it to a hypothesis that you and your team have prioritized. <%= deliverable "Brief writeup of your proposed MVP as a pdf submitted to Latte" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Review**: Look at this cool site that Emad found: [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses). Poke around it and read 3 projects that interest you. I would like you to tell me what 3 you picked, give a one or two sentence summary of what the product is, and tell me one idea you got from reading it that you might be able to use. <%= deliverable "Write up answering those questions." %>
