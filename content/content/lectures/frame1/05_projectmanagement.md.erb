1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Estimation:** Read [What do you mean you need more time?](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/10/what-do-you-mean-you-need-more-time/). The lawn at my house is 10m x 20m. Estimate how much time it would take you to do, and justify your estimate carefully. Estimate how much you would charge me to do it once a week. Email me personally if you need any clarification. <%= deliverable "Write up your specific overall charge, and your overall time estimate in hours. Include a detailed justification of the time estimate and charge. How exactly did you arrive at thos figures? Write up as a pdf, submit to latte." %>

#### Best Practices and Rules of Thumb
* There should be buy-in and alignment about the specifics of the goal.
* Everyone on the team needs to know who is responsible for what
* Have agreements about communications: face to face, email, real time, whatever
* Have an agreed upon place to store work in progress.
* Write things down


#### Project Management: What, Who, When, How
* Purpose: Achieve a specific *goal*, that requires multiple *resources*, by performing a set of *tasks*, in the right *order* so as to achieve a desired standard of *quality* by a certain *date*
* [Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal): These characteristics can be seen at a macro for a very large project and at a micro level for a small subset.

#### Dealing with Uncertainty
* Very commonly there are lots of uncertainties: How many MVPs will we need? How hard will it be to find 100 people to talk to? How much time will it take to implement authentication?
* Develop a skill to make reasonable common sense assumtions. Will we need 0 MVPs? or will we need 10 MVPs? Then narrow it down
* If you have a lot of uncertainty now, you don't need much *data* to reduce it significantly. If you have much certainty already, you will need a lot of data to reduce it significantly.

#### The Goal
* Very basic failure mode is when a team is unclear about the goal
* Talk to team members and brainstorm until you agree on the goal.

#### Resources
* Generally, the people involved
* But there might be other resources, like money, space, outside dependencies
* You need to think carefully about "dependencies"

#### Steps (tasks, stories, etc.)
* A clear definition of what it entails
* The closer you are in time to the task, the more specific it should be

#### Risk
* Understand what parts of your project have the most risk
* Understand the impact of the risk
* What kind of risk?
  * Quality Risk? Will you create something of sufficient quality. What is sufficient quality?
  * Cost Risk? Will you be within your cost estimates? Do you have an absolute budget?
  * Time Risk? Will you complete your project on time? Where did the deadline come from? Is it absolute? What is the impact of missing the date? Can the date be changed?
  * Feature Risk? Will your project deliver all the subcomponents, or subdeliverables, or features that you think you need? Which features are must-have vs. nice-to-have?

#### Definitions
* Project: "an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim"
* Management: "the act or skill of controlling and making decisions about a business, project, department, sports team, etc"
* Planning: ": the act or process of making a plan to achieve or do something"

#### Dependencies
* Sometimes story A cannot be done before Story B. It is good to be explicitly aware of this.

#### Waterfall
* Specific set of phases
* Once one completes, the next one starts

* Business plans are dead (caveat: in the tech world, at least)
*



##### Agile
