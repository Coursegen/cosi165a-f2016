1. Term project teams:
  * Meet for at least one hour face to face to get to know each other and brainstorm about your idea.
  * Figure out when you will be able to meet as a team at least once a week.
  * Discuss and refine and align on the Term Project you are pursueing
	* *Everyone listen to each other*: What is your vision of the product? Try to be specific. Of course you still have to research it but trying to get aligned is very important!
  * As a team, start putting down some stakes in the ground:
    1. Tweet: Tweet length summary of the product
    1. User roles: What role or roles of users of this product (e.g. student, teacher, or buyer, seller, or, driver, or manager, employee, customer.)
    1. Product description: From the users' perspective, what problem does it solve? What pain does it relieve? What new value does it bring?
