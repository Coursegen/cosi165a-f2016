1. **Teams prepare outgoing email:** One way to get feedback will be to email a survey to groups outside Brandeis. These could be LinkedIn Groups, Quora postings, other special interest mailing lists. For each product, identify a specific group that could have useful information on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email question that you would send to them expecting an answer. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. **Teams Go Out of Building:** Go out of the building! Each member of each product team should take some hypotheses off the list to test outside the building. Make sure you record details of this round of out of the building work. What hypotheses were being tested, how did the tests go, who did them, and what results so far. You will need them for the final report.
1. **PILOT project team and self assessment**: Write a self and team assessment about your experience during the Pilot Project, touching on: What each person on your team, including yourself, did on the team, took responsibility for; give each one a grade, including yourself, and explain why you think they should get that grade. You might check the <%= link_to_background :grading %> under "Contribution to the team" to get an idea what to think about. Your post will be confidential and supplement the instructors' view on your contribution to the team during the pilot phase. Make sure you mention the team members names. <%= deliverable "Posted on latte as a pdf" %>  **\[graded for participation only\]**
