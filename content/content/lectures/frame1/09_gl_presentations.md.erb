* <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>**Teams - Draft Term Project Report**: Review the <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %> and especially the <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report %>. Work together to produce your draft final report. I realize that you still have a lot of time to do more work, so there will be major revisions in the coming weeks. However, this draft should be presentable and readable and do a great job presenting the results of your project so far. <%= team_deliverable "Draft Term Project Report as pdf" %>
* <%= timebadge %><%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **From our Guest Lecturer**: You can find the [materials for this homework](https://humongousmedia.wistia.com/projects/xq65uh7xek) here. Please take a look at the "HM Preso”  powerpoint deck (also provided in pdf for those without ppt).  During the class, I will briefly present it and ask for feedback both on the slides and my delivery. Please also take a look at the 2 very short videos.  During the class, we will discuss what are the similarities and differences between powerpoint presentations and video presentations. Answer these questions:
  1. What is the best presentation you’ve ever seen (Ted talks, Brandeis lectures, lockeroom speech, political debate, etc)? What made it good?
  1. What is the worst presentation you’ve ever seen ? What made it bad? If you were going to give a presentation to the class, what “persona” would you adopt (funny, satirical, professorial, friendly, etc)?
  1. What are the steps that you go through to create a great presentation?
  1. On a scale of 1-100, how terrified are you to present publicly?
  1. Which audiences are the most terrifying?
  1. How do you see presentations evolving in the coming years?
