1. **Teams prepare outgoing email:** One way to get feedback will be to email a survey to groups outside Brandeis. These could be LinkedIn Groups, Quora postings, other special interest mailing lists. For each product, identify a specific group that could have useful information on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email question that you would send to them expecting an answer. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. **Teams Go Out of Building:** Go out of the building! Each member of each product team should take some hypotheses off the list to test outside the building. Make sure you record details of this round of out of the building work. What hypotheses were being tested, how did the tests go, who did them, and what results so far. You will need them for the final report.
