	* <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Submit some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?" %>
1. Every student should spend 1-2 hours with at least one student (you pick who and how many, but more than 1) to work up a raw term project idea. Look over the [Term Project Ideas list](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055) as starting points but you are not limited to that. The group together needs to write down notes about the idea focusing on what it is, who it's for and how it will make money, and a link to those notes to this list of raw ideas [Cosi165a 2016 Products](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/16GUw3u7-PSEOR7qabpH76oRVC3T7lVDjOoFhP0Qn0bc/edit?usp=sharing). In class we will give each group a chance to explain their idea. <%= deliverable "Add a link to your raw product description to Cosi165a 2016 Products" %>

#### Discussion
* Open discussion on working on projects in teams
* Clarifying what it means to be on a project
* Team dynamics is hard. Alignment is hard
* Start by talking over what product your team wants to pick
* What is your lattitude around the basic vision?

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
