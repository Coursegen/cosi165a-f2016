1. Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post with some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?"%>
1. Each pair "Champions" one product
  * Decide and enter your pair's name into the Teams of Two spreadsheet
  * Look over the list of ideas generated so far and the comments
  * Select one (or if you must, two) product ideas you want to champion and enter them
  * Do not select one that someone else has selected!
  * Develop the idea further into a one page proposal
  * Be ready to present it to the rest of the class

#### Plan for today
* Open discussion on working on projects in teams
	* Clarifying what it means to be on a project
	* Team dynamics is hard. Alignment is hard
	* Start by talking over what product your team wants to pick
	* What is your lattitude around the basic vision?
