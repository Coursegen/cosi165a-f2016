It's a classic of personal and team effectiveness. Think about it and your gut reaction to it. Do you understand it from your own experience? Have you tried to put the monkey on someone else? Has a peer or manager or professor tried to put a monkey on your back. Do you think the perspective of this article is constructive or manipulative? <%= deliverable "Submit your response." %>

#### Working in teams in this course

* Working in teams is hard and requires a businesslike, constructive, flexible, respectful behavior among the team members. Remember that I am not asking you to become best friends, just to figure out how to get the most out of each other.  We use peer and self assessments, because by myself I won't be able to tell if you are just along for the ride, or actually doing a lot of work.

* In my experience, on rare occasions, one member of the team becomes a bystander while others do the work, or one member takes over and does almost all the work. This is not the idea, so I might confidentially ask students their view of how well the team is functioning.
