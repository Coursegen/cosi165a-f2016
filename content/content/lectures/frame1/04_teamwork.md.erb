<%= homework_hdr %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Read** Read these two articles: [The Bootstart Manifesto](https://blog.leanstack.com/the-bootstart-manifesto-65b41da6216#.dfeu5qxlk) and [Reconsider](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f#.vs8xa6c5b). The reason I am asking you to read these two articles is that each presents a particular view on startups. I realize that not everyone in this class wants to be an Entrepreneur and my goal is to help you think critically about those choices and how you undertake them. Which article speaks the most to you? From which article did you have the biggest "AHA" reaction? What are two or three key takeaways that have personal meaning to you? <%= deliverable "A 1 page writeup on your reactions to both articles" %>
