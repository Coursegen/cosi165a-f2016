#### Working in teams

* Working in teams is hard and requires a businesslike, constructive, flexible, respectful behavior among the team members. Remember that I am not asking you to become best friends, just to figure out how to get the most out of each other.  We use peer and self assessmentws, because by myself I won't be able to tell if you are just along for the ride, or actually doing a lot of work.

* In my experience, on rare occasions, one member of the team becomes a bystander while others do the work, or one member takes over and does almost all the work. This is not the idea, so I might confidentially ask students their view of how well the team is functioning.

* For team deliverables each student on the team will get the same score on each item. A student will likely be on a different team for the pilot vs. the term project but in any event, each member of the team gets the same score on each team deliverable.

* Notice that separate from the grade for team deliverables there is an individual grade for your work as a team member. Are you an active contributor, do the other team members rely and count on you, do you add to or delete from the drama
