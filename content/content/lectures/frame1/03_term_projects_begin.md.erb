I want to build on last Thursday's meeting. So, in order to make today's class most effective I am asking you to invest real time and effort into the preparation. Basically for the product ideas that you are the most optimistic about, I would like you to go another level deeper.

Referring again to the [Cosi165a Pairs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ-as72YAfvgmigh_UgYtk9V40f6b2e3-G0F2_8ryss/edit#gid=0), I need every student to review and update that spreadsheet, as follows.

* Every student needs to be mentioned in the spreadsheet. Either as a member of a pair or by yourself.
* Every student needs a link to a worked out description of the product that they like the best. To students of a pair can point to the same link.
* A worked out description means that it covers the usual key points as you understand them. For example:
  1. Product name
  1. Tweet length summary of product
  1. Description of what it does
  1. What kind of customer is it for?
  1. What "job" does it do for a user or customer?
  1. Why you think it's cool
