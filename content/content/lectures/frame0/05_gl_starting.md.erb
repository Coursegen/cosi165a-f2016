1. Pilot Project Teams: Review and add to your plans; update your Pilot Project Report; Design and perform at least two out of the building experiments, making sure they are responsive to a specific hypothesis. You can dole out the work to team members or do them together, whatever you prefer. You are now at Draft 3 of the Pilot Project Report.
1. Read [How to start a startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/) (or watch the video, but if you do, don't miss the transcript comments). <%= deliverable "Respond to these homework questions in at most 1-2 pages. Submit to Latte by 10:00am on day of class as a PDF"%>
Homework questions:
	1. If you had to start a company tomorrow, what's your best idea?
	1. If you presented your idea to Sam Altman (the lecturer in the video above), what do you think his feedback and criticism would be?
	1. Describe an idea (anything, not necessarily a startup) from the past that you initially dismissed as crazy/absurd/dumb/"it will never work" that ended up being successful.  What were the contributors to success that surprised you?
	1. What do the first 5 years of your post-graduation career look like (best guess)?
