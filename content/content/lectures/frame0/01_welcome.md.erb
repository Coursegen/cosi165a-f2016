<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. Read article by Paul Graham about [How to get startup ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).  <%= deliverable "Write a short post reflecting on this article. Focus on what some points he made that you didn't understand or agree with; and some that you think are excellent and meaningful. Explain what he means by the 'schlep factor'. Be subtle. 3-4 paragraphs. Post as a pdf to Latte" %>

1. Read this article: ["You can't teach entrepreneurship"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/babson/2012/05/24/you-cant-teach-entrepreneurship/) Come up with your thoughts on why people say this, what they mean when they say it, and whether you agree with it.

1. Read this article: [Effective Learning Environment](http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-professor-blog/effective-learning-environment-shared-responsibility/?ET=facultyfocus:e58:302127a:&st=email).

	1. Identify things other students do that make learning in the classroom or online difficult.
