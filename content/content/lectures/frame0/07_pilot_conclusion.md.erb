<%= homework_hdr %>
1.	*Sorry that this description is so long, I just want to give you detailed instructions!!*
	* Review and update your Pilot Project Report with new or refined hypotheses. I'd like to see meaningful set of hypotheses. Make sure you have some of each kind, problem, customer, leap of faith, etc.  Tighten them up.
	* You should have clarified specifically who the customer is and where you could find one.You should now be working on solution hypotheses to try and validate. Essentially, what features do the customers want? Do they want a live tour guide or a recorded tour? Do they want a variety of types of tours, and if so, based on what? Expertise of the guide? Age of the guide?
	* Take more steps to get out of the building and validate more hypotheses. You can use surveys, but also personal meetings, emails, facebook, searching through newsgroups and any of the other techniques we've discussed.
	* Look at deliverables defined here: <%=link_to_topic :pilot_project %>.
	* Prepare to present your final report to the class in class today.
	* <%= team_deliverable ("Pilot project Report, Final") %>
