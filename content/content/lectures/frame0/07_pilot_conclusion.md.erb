1. <%= pdfbadge %> *Sorry that this description is so long, I just want to give you detailed instructions!!*

    Review and update your Pilot Project Report with new or refined hypotheses. I'd like to see meaningful set of hypotheses. Identify your leap of faith hypotheses if possible. Try to get each of the other kinds of hypotheses.

    Here are some (useful and less useful) questions: Who is the customer? Where can you find one? Where do they hang out? Do they have this problem? What products or services would work best? Does it make sense to limit it to a college? How often should deals be posted or updated? Should students be able to propose deals? Do they want an email alert or an app? Do they want to use messaging? Does the merchant want to collect information abou the customers?

    Try to validate as much as possible outside the building. You can use surveys, but also personal meetings, emails, facebook, searching through newsgroups and any of the other techniques we've discussed.

    Look at deliverables defined here: <%=link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>. Prepare to present your final report to the class in class today. <%= team_deliverable ("Pilot project Report, Final") %>
