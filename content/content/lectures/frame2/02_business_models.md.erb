1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> <%= timebadge %> View this [video by Michael Skok](http://mjskok.com/resource/funding-strategies-to-go-distance), a well known venture capitalist.  I won’t cover all this financing strategy in this, but will focus more on how to think about milestones, capital and proof. <%= deliverable "Do warmup quiz for today's reading" %>

* **Teams**: Work up the Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalter)
  <iframe width="460" height="259" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QoAOzMTLP5s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	* Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work. Osterwalter and his colleagues organize the business model space into nine **building blocks** which suggest a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them. Try to really understand what each block is about.
	* Divide up the Business Model Canvas 'building blocks' among your team. Each team member must do some more web research on the Osterwalter's Business Model Canvas to supplement the small summary in the video. Look for what questions you should ask and answer about your part of the canvas. <%= deliverable "Your thoughts about \"your block\" as it pertains to your team's term project, and response to key questions posed by the Business Model Canvas with respect to your block and your term project, as a pdf. Include your name and assignment." %>

#### Feedback Sessions
* Each project is different so each team's final deliverables might be somewhat different in structure.
* Hoping each team excels because the final deliverables will account for 40% of the grade
* I will give you customized feedback and ideas on how to make it better and get a higher grade
* Each team, schedule a 1/2 hour meeting with me to look at your draft final deliverables
