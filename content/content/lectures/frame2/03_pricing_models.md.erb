#### Pricing Models
* My terminology
* A subset of the business model
* Explanation of who pays and what they pay for
* Ask yourself some questions:
	* Who is getting value out of this business?
	* Who is willing to pay for that value?
	* What exactly are they willing to pay for?
	* When are they most likely to be willing to pay for it?
	* How often are they willing to pay for it?

##### Discussion about "our" products

* Each team come up with at last TWO distinct pricing models for your product.
* Take 15 minutes. Consider:
	* Will the model "make sense" to the buyer?
	* Will they be willing to pay it?
	* Is the pricing anchored with any other prices or expectations?
* Present them to class
