title: The Term Project
---
The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* Think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* Develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point

#### Teams

We will work in teams of 3-4 students. Each team, by the end of the term, will have defined a new product or service, at least up to a point of being ready to seek funding. The content of the classroom work should be directly applicable to the project work. The high level objectives for each team are:

* Work as a team where everyone contributes. Figure out how you will be effective and make decisions.
* Describe and flesh out an actual product or service that you want to build.
* Follow a lean startup methodology to refine and test and describe the product in detail.
* Articulate and build your MVPs, pivot as needed
* Get out of the building and talk to real users and customers
* Capture learnings along all the dimensions of the business model.
* Prepare for a solid presentation of the product by the end of the semester

#### Product Choices
The team has to come up with a validated business model for a product or service with the following characteristics:

* it should solve a problem we believe people really have
* we have evidence that people would pay money to solve it
* our solution involves technology of some sort
* we should have reason to believe that the product can be built

##### Hints and tips

* <%= link_to_topic :product_ideas %>: A list of product ideas that we provide to prime your thinking. You are welcome to use one of these, but likely you will generate your own.
* <%= link_to_topic :choose_product %>: Some guidelines and questions you should ask yourself to help you choose and define the product.

#### Final Deliverables
There are three final deliverables that will be due on the day of the project showcases, where each team will also deliver a presentation to a panel of investor/mentors.
