title: Term Project Outline

<br/>

<%= callout("Revision", " I've recast this into a somewhat more formal series of three stages. Each stage corresponds to about 2 1/2 weeks, and ends with a 1 hour team meeting with either your TA Partner (Stage 1) or with me (Stage 2 and 3)") %>

#### Stage 1: Formation (Oct 1 to Oct 20)

During this stage the team is getting used to each other, and there are lots of discussions to focus the vision and align around it. You will be brainstorming and documenting your preliminary insights and efforts and getting real world feedback.

Have a kickoff meeting to get to know each other. Decide how you will make decisions and who should be team lead. Decide how you will communicate, what expectations everyone has about time commitment, responsiveness, etc. Work on alignment of your vision.

The team should set up Trello and a Google Shared Drive. Make all team members be collaborators, and invite Pito and the TAs as read-only so we can read your content. Use Trello for project coordination and management, and place all your documents (starting with your vision document) in this folder.

Begin brainstorming and writing down specific problems that you think your product solves. What are the problems your product is being hired to solve? And at the same time, create a list of the customers who will want your product. Keep in mind the distinction between customers (who pay) and users (who benefit). Sometimes they are the same, sometimes not. Sometimes you are creating a two (or multi) sided marketplace, e.g. eBay, where you have customers want to acquire things and customers who want to sell things.

The most important ongoing work will be your hypotheses and the MVPs you run to test them. So create a separate document to maintain your ongoing list. Categorize the hypotheses according to the various types you've learned about. You should expect to keep these up to date as you progress through the semester.

And right along with that, start a continuing process of experimentation by getting out of the building. Refer to <%= link_to_topic :mvp_taxonomy %> for a reminder of the tools you have in your arsenal. Use as many of them as needed. Guard against subjective "gut level" opinion. However also allow common sense to play a part. No need to test something that everyone agrees is **really** self evident.

##### Deliverables

* **Collaboration**: Trello and Google shared folder

* **Vision**: Vision document

* **Hypotheses:** Priorized and classified by type. Including whether they've been tested and what the results were

* **MVPs**: List of MVPs and "Out of the building" work, with brief summaries of process and outcomes

* **Customers**: List of customers, profile of their role in your business

#### Stage 2: Focus (Oct 27 to Nov 15)

* **Hypotheses and experiments** Keep on adding and modifying your list of hypotheses. And keep on building MVPs based on what you are learning, getting out of the building and keeping good notes.

* **Mockup**: At some point in your validation you will need to create a demonstrable paper prototype. Depending on the needs you have several options. Sometimes a static screen does the job, sometimes you need a series of screens to allow a test user to actually interact with your prototype. You may elect to go one step further and design a working model. This might take the form of an html/javascript applet, or an iPhone or Android test app. Remember to consider your objectives in doing this. What are you trying to test exactly? What hypothesis or purpose does it serve? Have you validated enough about your approach to justify the working model?

* **Elevator Pitch**: Design your elevator pitch. See <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>.

* **Value Proposition Canvas** Work through the process outlined here: [Value Propisition Canvas](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html) and actually complete (or answer all the questions of) the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)

##### Deliverables
* **Elevator Pitch**: Elevator Pitch document

* **Mockup:** This can be a Paper Prototype, a non-working model, a working model, a rendering of the product.

* **Value Prop**: Your completed Value Proposition Canvas

* **Channels** Given the customers you are considering, can you articulate the channels by which you will reach them? You need to think about where those types of users can be found, and what means you have to access them. Initially you will want to talk to them to further validate your concept but at some point you will be looking at asking the to use, download or buy your product.

#### Stage 3: Business Model (Nov 15 to Dec 6)

* **Competition**: What is out there that attempts to solve the same (or similar) problem for the same (or similar) users? How will you be different from your competition?

* **Pricing**: What approach to capturing revenue is right for your product? Who are the users vs. the customers? Is this a two sided market? Who pays? Who gets paid?

* **Revenue**: What are all the sources of revenue that you can identify?

* **Growth**: What is your engine of growth? What techniques will likely work to achieve growth and make your business sustainable?

* **Costs**: Where are the costs in your product? Consider your startup phase and your growth phase. Consider material, service, and especially people costs.

##### Deliverables

* **Final Report**: Write a final report (due on last day of class). Here is a guide to writing the <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report %>

* **Final Presentation**: A formal 10 minute presenation, rehearsed and presented on Showcase Day.

* **Single Page Site**: A summary of the project, process and results.
