title: Term Project Outline
---
#### Context

The following is an approximate outline of the work you will be doing as a team to complete the term project. It is not literally a step by step recipe. It helps you identify an order of things to do to get to a successful Showcase Day. The steps are in rough time order.

It is an iterative process with you returning to previous elements based on data you collect from going out of the building. Start looking for qualitative information but work up to actual quantitative data.

* **Kickoff Meeting**: Get to know each other. Decide how you will make decisions and who should be team lead. Work on alignment of your vision.

* **Vision**: Initial draft of your product vision statement. It can be two or three paragraphs. It should be descriptive enough so a civilian can understand it.

* **Problems** As a team, figure out the problems that you think your product solves. What are the problems your product is being hired to solve? Write them as testable hypotheses. Remember that you might have a two sided market with each side having a different set of problems.

* **Customers** Think about and articulate the ustomers who will want your product. Think about how to make these hypotheses testable.

* **Tools**: Set up Trello and a Google Shared Drive. Make all team members be collaborators, and invite Pito and the TAs as read-only so we can read your content. Use Trello for project coordination and management, and place all your documents (starting with your vision document) in this folder.

* **Hypotheses** Build on your list of initial hypotheses and place them in a separate document. A google sheet would work well for this. Categorize the hypotheses according to the various types you've learned about. You should expect to keep these up to date as you progress through the semester.

* **Get out of the building**: Start a continuing process of experimentation. At this stage we should have an email and a google doc as the initial tools. You will need to think carefully about who you are polling and asking questions of. There are a variety of ways in which you can validate. Use as many of them as needed. Guard against subjective "gut level" opinion. However also allow common sense to play a part. No need to test something that everyone agrees is **really** self evident.

* **Elevator Pitch**: Design your elevator pitch. See <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>. It would be a good addition to your Project Final report, and who knows you might actually run into the President in an elevator and have use of it. Also can be useful in interviews.

* **UVP** Write a very brief (tweet length) catchy and descriptive summary of your product. It's something between a slogan and a definition.

* **Value Proposition Canvas** Work through the process outlined here: [Value Propisition Canvas](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html) and actually complete (or answer all the questions of) the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)


* **Channels** Given the customers you are considering, can you articulate the channels by which you will reach them? You need to think about where those types of users can be found, and what means you have to access them. Initially you will want to talk to them to further validate your concept but at some point you will be looking at asking the to use, download or buy your product.

* **Validation**: As you accumulate testable hypotheses, start validating. Focus on the easiest to validate, and most impactful hypotheses. Especially consider which ones are your leap of faith hypotheses.

* **Paper Prototype**: At some point in your validation you will need to create a demonstrable paper prototype. Depending on the needs you have several options. Sometimes a static screen does the job, sometimes you need a series of screens to allow a test user to actually interact with your prototype.

* **Working model**: You may elect to go one step further and design a working model. This might take the form of an html/javascript applet, or an iPhone or Android test app. Remember to consider your objectives in doing this. What are you trying to test exactly? What hypothesis or purpose does it serve? Have you validated enough about your approach to justify the working model?

* **Competition**: What is out there that attempts to solve the same (or similar) problem for the same (or similar) users? How will you be different from your competition?

* **Pricing**: What approach to capturing revenue is right for your product? Who are the users vs. the customers? Is this a two sided market? Who pays? Who gets paid?

* **Revenue**: What are all the sources of revenue that you can identify?

* **Growth**: What is your engine of growth? What techniques will likely work to achieve growth and make your business sustainable?

* **Costs**: Where are the costs in your product? Consider your startup phase and your growth phase. Consider material, service, and especially people costs.

* **Final Report**: Write a final report (due on last day of class). Here is a guide to writing the <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report %>

* **Final Presentation**: A formal 10 minute presenation, rehearsed and presented on Showcase Day.

* **Single Page Site**: A summary of the project, process and results.
